EVENT TERMS DOCUMENTATION
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat/data-eventterms.php#gap

- time, (ms) dtype = Long Integer

Description:
Time when the event occurred. Times are reported in milliseconds since the epoch ( 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z), and do not include leap seconds. 
In certain output formats, the date is formatted for readability.

Additional Information:
We indicate the date and time when the earthquake initiates rupture, which is known as the "origin" time. Note that large earthquakes can 
continue rupturing for many 10's of seconds. We provide time in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). Seismologists use UTC to avoid confusion 
caused by local time zones and daylight savings time. On the individual event pages, times are also provided for the time at the epicenter, 
and your local time based on the time your computer is set.


- latitude, (degrees) dtype = decimal

Typical Values:
[-90.0, 90.0]

Description
Decimal degrees latitude. Negative values for southern latitudes.

Additional Information:
An earthquake begins to rupture at a hypocenter which is defined by a position on the surface of the earth (epicenter) and a depth below this 
point (focal depth). We provide the coordinates of the epicenter in units of latitude and longitude. The latitude is the number of degrees north (N) 
or south (S) of the equator and varies from 0 at the equator to 90 at the poles. Coordinates are given in the WGS84 reference frame. The 
position uncertainty of the hypocenter location varies from about 100 m horizontally and 300 meters vertically for the best located events, 
those in the middle of densely spaced seismograph networks, to 10s of kilometers for global events in many parts of the world.


- longitude, (degrees) dtype = decimal

Typical Values
[-180.0, 180.0]

Description
Decimal degrees longitude. Negative values for western longitudes.

Additional Information
An earthquake begins to rupture at a hypocenter which is defined by a position on the surface of the earth (epicenter) and a depth below this point 
(focal depth). We provide the coordinates of the epicenter in units of latitude and longitude. The longitude is the number of degrees east (E) or west (W) of 
the prime meridian which runs through Greenwich, England. The longitude varies from 0 at Greenwich to 180 and the E or W shows the direction from Greenwich. 
Coordinates are given in the WGS84 reference frame. The position uncertainty of the hypocenter location varies from about 100 m horizontally and 300 meters 
vertically for the best located events, those in the middle of densely spaced seismograph networks, to 10s of kilometers for global events in many parts of the world.


- depth, (kilometers) dtype = decimal

Typical Values
[0, 1000]

Description
Depth of the event in kilometers.

Additional Information
The depth where the earthquake begins to rupture. This depth may be relative to the WGS84 geoid, mean sea-level, or the average elevation of the seismic stations which provided arrival-time data for the earthquake location. The choice of reference depth is dependent on the method used to locate the earthquake, which varies by seismic network. 

Sometimes when depth is poorly constrained by available seismic data, the location program will set the depth at a fixed value. For example, 33 km is often used as a default depth for earthquakes determined to be shallow, but whose depth is not satisfactorily determined by the data, whereas default depths of 5 or 10 km are often used in mid-continental areas and on mid-ocean ridges since earthquakes in these areas are usually shallower than 33 km.


- mag, (mag) dtype = decima;

Typical Values
[-1.0, 10.0]

Description
The magnitude for the event. See also magType.


- magType, dtype = string


Typical Values
“Md”, “Ml”, “Ms”, “Mw”, “Me”, “Mi”, “Mb”, “MLg”

Description
The method or algorithm used to calculate the preferred magnitude for the event.

Additional Information
See Magnitude Types Table.

- nst, dtype = integer 

Description
The total number of seismic stations used to determine earthquake location.

Additional Information
Number of seismic stations which reported P- and S-arrival times for this earthquake. 


- gap, dtype = decimal                            <<<<<<<<<<< outliers >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Typical Values
[0.0, 180.0]

Description
The largest azimuthal gap between azimuthally adjacent stations (in degrees). In general, the smaller this number, the more reliable is the calculated horizontal position of the earthquake. Earthquake locations in which the azimuthal gap exceeds 180 degrees typically have large location and depth uncertainties.


- dmin, (degrees) dtype = decimal              <<<<<<<<<<< quality >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Typical Values
[0.4, 7.1]

Description
Horizontal distance from the epicenter to the nearest station (in degrees). 1 degree is approximately 111.2 kilometers. In general, the smaller this number, the more reliable is the calculated depth of the earthquake.


- rms, (seconds) dtype = decimal                  <<<<<<<<<<< quality >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Typical Values
[0.13,1.39]

Description
The root-mean-square (RMS) travel time residual, in sec, using all weights. This parameter provides a measure of the fit of the observed arrival times to the predicted arrival times for this location. Smaller numbers reflect a better fit of the data.


- net, dtype = string

Typical Values
ak, at, ci, hv, ld, mb, nc, nm, nn, pr, pt, se, us, uu, uw

Description
The ID of a data contributor. Identifies the network considered to be the preferred source of information for this event.


- id, dtype = string

Typical Values
A (generally) two-character network identifier with a (generally) eight-character network-assigned code.

Description
A unique identifier for the event. This is the current preferred id for the event, and may change over time. See the "ids" GeoJSON format property.


- updated, (milliseconds) dtype = long integer

Description
Time when the event was most recently updated. Times are reported in milliseconds since the epoch. In certain output formats, the date is formatted for readability.


- place, dtype = string

Description
Textual description of named geographic region near to the event. This may be a city name, or a Flinn-Engdahl Region name.

Additional Information
We use a GeoNames dataset to reference populated places that are in close proximity to a seismic event. 
GeoNames has compiled a list of cities in the United States where the population is 1,000 or greater (cities1000.txt). This is the primary list that we use when selecting nearby places. In order to provide the public with a better understanding for the location of an event we try to list a variety of places in our nearby places list. This includes the closest known populated place in relation to the seismic event (which based on our dataset will have a population of 1,000 or greater).


- type, dtype = string

Typical Values
“earthquake”, “quarry”

Description
Type of seismic event.


- horizontalError, (kilometers) dtype = decimal

Typical Values
[0, 100]

Description
Uncertainty of reported location of the event in kilometers.

Additional Information
The horizontal location error, in km, defined as the length of the largest projection of the three principal errors on a horizontal plane. The principal errors are the major axes of the error ellipsoid, and are mutually perpendicular. The horizontal and vertical uncertainties in an event's location varies from about 100 m horizontally and 300 meters vertically for the best located events, those in the middle of densely spaced seismograph networks, to 10s of kilometers for global events in many parts of the world. We report an "unknown" value if the contributing seismic network does not supply uncertainty estimates.


- depthError, (kilometers) dtype = decimal

Typical Values
[0, 100]

Description
Uncertainty of reported depth of the event in kilometers.

Additional Information
The depth error, in km, defined as the largest projection of the three principal errors on a vertical line.

- magError, dtype = decimal

Typical Values
[0, 100]

Description
Uncertainty of reported magnitude of the event. The estimated standard error of the magnitude. The uncertainty corresponds to the specific magnitude type being reported and does not take into account magnitude variations and biases between different magnitude scales. We report an "unknown" value if the contributing seismic network does not supply uncertainty estimates.


- magNst, dtype = integer

Description
The total number of seismic stations used to calculate the magnitude for this earthquake.


- status, dtype = string

Typical Values
“automatic”, “reviewed”, “deleted”

Description
Indicates whether the event has been reviewed by a human.

Additional Information
Status is either automatic or reviewed. Automatic events are directly posted by automatic processing systems and have not been verified or altered by a human. Reviewed events have been looked at by a human. The level of review can range from a quick validity check to a careful reanalysis of the event.


- locationSource, dtype = string

Typical Values
ak, at, ci, hv, ld, mb, nc, nm, nn, pr, pt, se, us, uu, uw
