This data set is taken from USGS(U.S Geological Survey). The USGS provides reliable scientific information to describe and understand the Earth; minimize loss of life and property from natural disasters; manage water, biological, energy, and mineral resources; and enhance and protect our quality of life.

As part of it's program, USGS monitors and reports on earthquakes, assesses earthquake impacts and hazards, and conducts targeted research on the causes and effects of earthquakes. The USGS provides real-time notifications, feeds and web services about earthquakes just after they happen. Further details can be found in the link below,

# My Files

The results of my analysis are recorded and explained in more depth in the 'Presentation' files. It was made in Keynote and then converted to PowerPoint so there may be some conversion errors. 

Apart from the earthquake data set, there is also a 'column_notes.csv' which I used to help me wrap my head around the earthquake columns. 

Finally, the column_def.txt is a detailed description of the columns using the information provided by the dataset providers.
